400 Bad Request: This status code is suitable when the request is syntactically incorrect,
 malformed, or missing required parameters. In your case, if the request is missing essential 
 fields, a 400 status code would be appropriate, as it signifies a client error due to the 
 request not meeting the expected format.


 204 No Content: This status code is typically 
 used to indicate a successful request that has no 
 additional data to send. However, using it to indicate a missing required
  field might be a bit confusing, as 204 usually implies success. 
  It might not be the most semantically accurate choice for indicating
   a validation error.
